307|the federal arbitration act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
308|a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration as specified in the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
309|-lrb- the aaa provides a form demand for arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/showpdf?doc=adrstg_004175 and a separate form for california residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/showpdf?doc=adrstg_015822 . -rrb- |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
310|the arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the aaa 's roster of arbitrators . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
311|if the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven -lrb- 7 -rrb- days of delivery of the demand for arbitration , then the aaa will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
312|unless you and academia.edu otherwise agree , the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
313|if your claim does not exceed $ 10,000 , then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and academia.edu submit to the arbitrator , unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
314|if your claim exceeds $ 10,000 , your right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
315|subject to the aaa rules , the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties , consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
316|the arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
317|the arbitrator 's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
318|judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
319|the arbitrator 's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the `` limitation of liability '' section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
320|the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant 's individual claim . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
321|if you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys ' fees and expenses , to the extent provided under applicable law . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
322|academia.edu will not seek , and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover , attorneys ' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
323|your responsibility to pay any aaa filing , administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
324|however , if your claim for damages does not exceed $ 75,000 , academia.edu will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose -lrb- as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11 -lrb- b -rrb- -rrb- . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

327|the failure of academia.edu to enforce any right or provision of these terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
328|the waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of academia.edu . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
329|except as expressly set forth in these terms , the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these terms or otherwise . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
330|if for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these terms invalid or unenforceable , that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

1817|alternatively , you may assert your claims in small claims court , if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual -lrb- non-class , non-representative -rrb- basis . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

1826|arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
1827|arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury , and court review of an arbitration award is very limited . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

1833|the use of the word `` arbitrator '' in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration ; rather , the aaa 's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this agreement to arbitrate . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

2454|other than this limited license and other rights you grant in these terms , evernote acknowledges and agrees that we do not obtain any right , title or interest from you under these terms in any of your content . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

2456|in order to enable evernote to operate the service , we must obtain from you certain limited license rights to process your content that is covered by intellectual property rights so that technical actions we take in operating the service are not considered legal violations . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
2457|for example , copyright laws could prevent us from processing , maintaining , storing , backing-up and distributing certain content , unless you give us these rights . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
2458|accordingly , by using the service and uploading content , you are granting evernote a license to display , perform and distribute your content and to modify -lrb- for technical purposes , e.g. , making sure content is viewable on smartphones as well as computers and other devices -rrb- and reproduce such content to enable evernote to operate the service . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

3839|if we can not resolve a dispute within sixty -lrb- 60 -rrb- days of receipt of such notice , then either you or we may elect to submit the dispute to formal arbitration as hereinafter described . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
3840|with arbitration -lrb- a -rrb- there is no judge or jury , -lrb- b -rrb- the arbitration proceedings and arbitration outcome are subject to certain confidentiality rules , and -lrb- c -rrb- judicial review of the arbitration outcome is limited . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

3847|if a party properly submits the dispute to the aaa for formal arbitration and the aaa is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty -lrb- 60 -rrb- days of the filing of a `` demand for arbitration , '' then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the judicial arbitration and mediation services inc. -lrb- `` jams '' -rrb- using jams ' streamlined arbitration rules and procedures , or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of linden lab consent to in writing , except , as noted above , that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

3853|you and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator 's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules -lrb- including any rules regarding hardship -rrb- ; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require linden lab to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable , or if the arbitrator -lrb- s -rrb- determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the dispute , then linden lab will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

5999|if you do n't provide niantic with an arbitration opt-out notice within the thirty -lrb- 30 -rrb- day period , you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses -lrb- a -rrb- and -lrb- b -rrb- above . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6000|the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any ip protection action or , if you timely provide niantic with an arbitration opt-out notice , will be the state and federal courts located in the northern district of california , and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts . |1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1

6002|further , unless both you and niantic otherwise agree in writing , the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person 's claims , and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6003|if this specific paragraph is held unenforceable , then the entirety of this `` dispute resolution '' section will be deemed void . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

6008|a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration as specified in the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6009|-lrb- the aaa provides a general demand for arbitration -rrb- the arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the aaa 's roster of arbitrators . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6010|if the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven -lrb- 7 -rrb- days of delivery of the demand for arbitration , then the aaa will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6011|unless you and niantic otherwise agree , the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6012|if your claim does not exceed $ 10,000 , then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and niantic submit to the arbitrator , unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

6014|subject to the aaa rules , the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties , consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6015|the arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6016|the arbitrator 's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6017|judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6018|the arbitrator 's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the `` limitation of liability '' section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6019|the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant 's individual claim . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6020|if you prevail in arbitration , you will be entitled to an award of attorneys ' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6021|niantic will not seek , and hereby waives , all rights it may have under applicable law to recover attorneys ' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6022|our responsibility to pay any aaa filing , administrative , and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the aaa rules . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6023|however , if your claim for damages does not exceed $ 75,000 , niantic will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose -lrb- as measured by the standards set forth in federal rules of civil procedure 11 -lrb- b -rrb- -rrb- . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

6028|if any provision of these terms is held invalid or unenforceable -lrb- either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the `` dispute resolution '' section above or by a court of competent jurisdiction , but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an arbitration opt-out notice in accordance with the terms set forth above -rrb- , that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible , and the other provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

6676|snap group limited terms of service |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6677|-lrb- if you live outside the united states -rrb- |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6678|effective : january 10 , 2017 |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6679|we 're thrilled you 've decided to use snapchat and our other products and services , all of which we refer to simply as the `` services . '' |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6680|we 've drafted these terms of service -lrb- which we call the `` terms '' -rrb- so you 'll know the rules that govern our relationship with you . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6681|although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the terms , there are places where these terms may still read like a traditional contract . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6682|there 's a good reason for that : these terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and snap group limited . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6683|so please read them carefully . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6684|by using the services , you agree to the terms . |1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|1
6685|of course , if you do n't agree with them , then do n't use the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6686|these terms apply to you if you live outside the united states or if you are using the services on behalf of a business located outside the united states . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6687|if you live in the united states or are using the services on behalf of a business located there , the snap inc. . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6688|arbitration notice : if you 're using the services on behalf of a business , then your business will be bound by the arbitration clause that appears later in these terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6689|no one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6690|we may offer additional services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6691|so please read all terms carefully . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6692|by using the services , you affirm that : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6693|you can form a binding contract with snap group limited . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6694|you are not a person who is barred from receiving the services under the laws of the united states , the united kingdom , or any other applicable jurisdiction -- meaning that you do not appear on the u.s. treasury department 's list of specially designated nationals or face any other similar prohibition . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6695|you will comply with these terms and all applicable local , state , national , and international laws , rules , and regulations . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6696|if you are using the services on behalf of a business or some other entity , you affirm that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these terms and to agree to these terms on behalf of the business or entity . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6697|snap group limited grants you a personal , worldwide , royalty-free , non-assignable , nonexclusive , revocable , and non-sublicensable license to access and use the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6698|this license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the services ' benefits in a way that these terms and our usage policies , such as our community guidelines , allow . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6699|any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades , updates , or other new features . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6700|you may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device 's settings . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6701|you may not copy , modify , distribute , sell , or lease any part of our services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6702|nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software , unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6703|many of our services let you create , upload , post , send , receive , and store content . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6704|when you do that , you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6705|but you grant us a license to use that content . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6706|how broad that license is depends on which services you use and the settings you have selected . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6707|for all services other than live , local , and any other crowd-sourced service , you grant snap group limited , snap inc. , and their affiliates a worldwide , royalty-free , sublicensable , and transferable license to host , store , use , display , reproduce , modify , adapt , edit , publish , and distribute that content for as long as you use the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6708|this license is for the limited purpose of operating , developing , providing , promoting , and improving the services and researching and developing new ones . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6709|because live , local , and any other crowd-sourced services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest , the license you grant us for content submitted to those services is broader . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6710|in addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph , you also grant us a license to create derivative works from , promote , exhibit , broadcast , syndicate , sublicense , publicly perform , and publicly display content submitted to live , local , or any other crowd-sourced services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods -lrb- now known or later developed -rrb- . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6711|to the extent it 's necessary , when you appear in , create , upload , post , or send live , local , or other crowd-sourced content , you also grant snap group limited , snap inc. , and our affiliates and business partners the unrestricted , worldwide right and license to use your name , likeness , and voice . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6712|this means , among other things , that you will not be entitled to any compensation from snap group limited , snap inc. , or our affiliates and business partners if your name , likeness , or voice is conveyed through live , local , or other crowd-sourced services , either on the snapchat application or on one of our business partner 's platforms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6713|for more information about how to tailor who can watch your content , please take a look at our privacy policy and support site . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6714|while we 're not required to do so , we may access , review , screen , and delete your content at any time and for any reason , including if we think your content violates these terms . |1|-1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1
6715|you alone , though , remain responsible for the content you create , upload , post , send , or store through the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6716|the services may contain advertisements . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6717|in consideration for snap group limited letting you access and use the services , you agree that we , snap inc. , our affiliates , and our third-party partners may place advertising on the services , including personalized advertising based upon the information you provide us or we collect or obtain about you . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6718|because the services contain content that you and other users provide us , advertising may sometimes appear near your content . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6719|we always love to hear from our users . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6720|but if you volunteer feedback or suggestions , just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6721|much of the content on our services is produced by users , publishers , and other third parties . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6722|whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately , the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6723|although snap group limited reserves the right to review all content that appears on the services and to remove any content that violates these terms , we do not necessarily review all of it . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6724|so we can not -- and do not -- take responsibility for any content that others provide through the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6725|through these terms and our community guidelines , we make clear that we do not want the services put to bad uses . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6726|but because we do not review all content , we can not guarantee that content on the services will always conform to our terms or guidelines . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6727|your privacy matters to us . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6728|you can learn how your information is handled when you use our services by reading the privacy policy . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6729|we encourage you to give the privacy policy a careful look because , by using our services , you agree that your information may be collected and processed by snap group limited in the uk and snap inc. in the u.s. , as well as their affiliates , and transferred outside of the country in which you reside , including to countries that may not have the same data-protection laws as your country . |1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|1
6730|snap group limited respects the rights of others . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6731|you therefore may not use the services in a manner that : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6732|violates or infringes someone else 's rights of publicity , privacy , copyright , trademark , or other intellectual-property right . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6733|bullies , harasses , or intimidates . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6734|spams or solicits our users . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6735|you must also respect the rights of snap group limited and its affiliates , including snap inc. . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6736|these terms do not grant you any right to : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6737|use branding , logos , designs , photographs , videos , or any other materials used in our services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6738|copy , archive , download , upload , distribute , syndicate , broadcast , perform , display , make available , or otherwise use any portion of the services or the content on the services except as set forth in these terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6739|use the services , any tools provided by the services , or any content on the services for any commercial purposes without our consent . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6740|in short : you may not use the services or the content on the services in ways that are not authorized by these terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6741|nor may you help anyone else in doing so . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6742|we therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our services any infringing material that we become aware of . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6743|and if snap group limited becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights , we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user 's account . |1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|1
6744|we make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6745|if you believe that anything on the services infringes a copyright that you own or control , please fill out this form . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6746|or you may file a notice with our designated agent : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6747|if you file a notice with our copyright agent , it must : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6748|contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6749|identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6750|identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed , or access to which is to be disabled , and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6751|provide your contact information , including your address , telephone number , and an email address . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6752|provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner , its agent , or the law . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6753|provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and , under penalty of perjury , that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6754|we try hard to keep our services a safe place for all users . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6755|but we ca n't guarantee it . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6756|that 's where you come in . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6757|by using the services , you agree that : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6758|you will not use the services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6759|you will not use any robot , spider , crawler , scraper , or other automated means or interface to access the services or extract other user 's information . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6760|you will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the services or other users ' content or information without our written consent . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6761|you will not use the services in a way that could interfere with , disrupt , negatively affect , or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the services , or that could damage , disable , overburden , or impair the functioning of the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6762|you will not use or attempt to use another user 's account , username , or password without their permission . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6763|you will not solicit login credentials from another user . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6764|you will not post content that contains pornography , graphic violence , threats , hate speech , or incitements to violence . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6765|you will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6766|you will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ , or attempt to access areas or features of the services that you are not authorized to access . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6767|you will not probe , scan , or test the vulnerability of our services or any system or network . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6768|you will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6769|we also care about your safety while using our services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6770|so do not use our services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6771|for example , never snap and drive . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6772|and never put yourself or others in harm 's way just to capture a snap . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6773|you are responsible for any activity that occurs in your snapchat account . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6774|so it 's important that you keep your account secure . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6775|one way to do that is to select a strong password that you do n't use for any other account . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6776|by using the services , you agree that , in addition to exercising common sense : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6777|you will not create more than one account for yourself . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6778|you will not create another account if we have already disabled your account , unless you have our written permission to do so . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6779|you will not buy , sell , rent , or lease access to your snapchat account , live , snaps , a snapchat username , or a friend link without our written permission . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6780|you will not share your password . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6781|you will not log in or attempt to access the services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6782|if you think that someone has gained access to your account , please immediately reach out to snapchat support . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6783|memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime , anywhere . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6784|by agreeing to these terms , you automatically enable memories . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6785|once memories is enabled , it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your snapchat account . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6786|but you can always turn off certain memories features through settings . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6787|one of the options we provide with memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode , which might be a pin or a passphrase or some other mechanism . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6788|this is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device ; by setting a passcode , you make it less likely that another person who gets ahold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of memories . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6789|but here 's a big warning : if you lose or forget your memories passcode , or if you enter the wrong one too many times , you will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of memories . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6790|we do n't offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6791|you are solely responsible for remembering your passcode . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6792|please go to our support site for more details on passcodes . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6793|your content in memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons , including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account . |1|-1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|1
6794|since we ca n't promise that your content will always be available , we recommend keeping a separate copy of the content you save to memories . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6795|we make no promise that memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6796|we reserve the right to set storage limits for memories , and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion . |1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1
6797|and just as with our other services , your use of memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data charges . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6798|you may not resell any memories features . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6799|this means you ca n't do something like use memories to operate your own file-storage or distribution service for other people . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6800|you are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our services , including text-messaging and data charges . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6801|if you 're unsure what those charges may be , you should ask your service provider before using the services . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6802|if you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a snapchat account , you must update your account information through settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6803|if you use a service , feature , or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our services -lrb- including services we jointly offer with the third party -rrb- , each party 's terms will govern the respective party 's relationship with you . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6804|neither snap group limited nor snap inc. is responsible or liable for a third party 's terms or actions taken under the third party 's terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6805|we 're relentlessly improving our services and creating new ones all the time . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6806|that means we may add or remove features , products , or functionalities , and we may also suspend or stop the services altogether . |1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|1
6807|we may take any of these actions at any time , and when we do , we will try to notify you beforehand , but this wo n't always be possible . |1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1
6808|while we hope you remain a lifelong snapchatter , you can terminate these terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6809|snap group limited may also terminate these terms with you at any time , for any reason . |1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|1
6810|and while we 'll try to give you advance notice , we ca n't guarantee it . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6811|our right to terminate these terms means that we may stop providing you with any services , or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the services . |1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|1
6812|for example , we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity , and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason . |1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1|-1|1
6813|regardless of who terminates these terms , both you and snap group limited continue to be bound by sections 3 , 6 , 9 , 10 , and 13-22 of the terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6814|you agree , to the extent permitted by law , to indemnify , defend , and hold harmless snap group limited , snap inc. , and our affiliates , directors , officers , stockholders , employees , licensors , and agents from and against any complaints , charges , claims , damages , losses , costs , liabilities , and expenses -lrb- including attorneys ' fees -rrb- due to , arising out of , or relating in any way to : -lrb- a -rrb- your access to or use of the services ; -lrb- b -rrb- your content ; and -lrb- c -rrb- your breach of these terms . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6815|we try to keep the services up and running and free of annoyances . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6816|but we make no promises that we will succeed . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
6817|the services are provided `` as is '' and `` as available '' and to the extent permitted by law without warranties of any kind , either express or implied , including , but not limited to , implied warranties , conditions , or other terms relating to merchantability , satisfactory quality , fitness for a particular purpose , title , quiet enjoyment , non-infringement , or arising from a course of dealing . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

7110|arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

7112|there may be more limited discovery than in court . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
7113|the arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court -lrb- including attorney fees -rrb- , except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

8720|it is your responsibility to know , understand and abide by these rules of conduct . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

8748|blizzard entertainment does not eavesdrop or monitor the content of your oral communication through the voice client . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8749|your written communication may be subject to review , modification , and/or deletion by blizzard entertainment without notice to you . |1|-1|-1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1
8750|additionally , you hereby acknowledge that blizzard entertainment is under no obligation to monitor chat , and you engage in chat at your own risk . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8751|when engaging in chat in world of warcraft , or otherwise utilizing world of warcraft , you may not : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8752|-lrb- 1 -rrb- transmit or post any content or use any language , in writing or orally , which , in the sole and absolute discretion of blizzard entertainment , is deemed to be offensive , including without limitation content or language that is unlawful , harmful , threatening , abusive , harassing , defamatory , vulgar , obscene , hateful , sexually explicit , or racially , ethnically or otherwise objectionable , nor may you use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the content and language restrictions listed above ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8753|-lrb- 2 -rrb- carry out any action with a disruptive effect , such as intentionally causing the chat screen to scroll faster than other users are able to read , or setting up macros with large amounts of text that , when used , can have a disruptive effect on the normal flow of chat , or using tools that distort or interfere with oral communication of the users ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8754|-lrb- 3 -rrb- disrupt the normal flow of dialogue in chat or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects other users including without limitation posting commercial solicitations and/or advertisements for goods and service available outside of the world of warcraft universe ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

8756|-lrb- 5 -rrb- communicate or post any user 's personal information in or on the world of warcraft , or websites or forums related to world of warcraft , except that a world of warcraft user may communicate his or her own personal information in a private message directed to a single user ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8757|-lrb- 6 -rrb- use bots or other automated techniques to collect information from world of warcraft or any forum or website owned or administered by blizzard entertainment ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8758|-lrb- 7 -rrb- harass , threaten , stalk , embarrass or cause distress , unwanted attention or discomfort to any user of world of warcraft or to blizzard entertainment representatives ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8759|-lrb- 8 -rrb- cheat or utilize world of warcraft `` exploits '' in any way , including without limitation modification of the game program files ; |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8760|-lrb- 9 -rrb- participate in any action that , in the sole and absolute opinion of blizzard entertainment , results or may result in an authorized user of world of warcraft being `` scammed '' or defrauded out of gold , weapons , armor , or any other items that user has earned through authorized game play in world of warcraft . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8761|rules related to game play . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8762|game play is what world of warcraft is all about . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8763|accordingly , the rules that govern game play in world of warcraft are taken very seriously by blizzard entertainment . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8764|note that blizzard entertainment considers all valid play styles in world of warcraft to be part of the game , and not harassment , so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance , including gravestone and/or corpse camping , is considered a part of the game . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8765|because world of warcraft is a `` player vs. player '' game , you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you , rather than contacting blizzard entertainment 's in-game customer service representatives , referred to herein as `` game masters , '' for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8766|nonetheless , certain acts go beyond what is `` fair '' and are considered serious violations of these terms of use . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8767|those acts include , but are not necessarily limited to , the following : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8768|-lrb- 1 -rrb- using or exploiting errors in design , features which have not been documented , and/or `` program bugs '' to gain access that is otherwise not available , or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8769|-lrb- 2 -rrb- connecting , or creating tools that allow you to connect , to world of warcraft 's proprietary interface or interfaces , other than those explicitly provided by blizzard entertainment for your use . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8770|-lrb- 3 -rrb- using tools that hack or otherwise alter the world of warcraft client or server software . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8771|-lrb- 4 -rrb- using software products that `` packet sniff '' or provide scripting and/or macroing to obtain information from world of warcraft . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8772|-lrb- 5 -rrb- anything that blizzard entertainment considers contrary to the `` essence '' of world of warcraft . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8773|blizzard entertainment may , in its sole and absolute discretion , offer certain users the opportunity to move characters from a heavily populated `` character migration '' server to a server designated by blizzard entertainment as a `` target server . '' |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8774|if you are offered the opportunity to migrate a character , please note the following : |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
8775|if your character is a `` guild master , '' it can not be migrated to a target server . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1

9358|agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9359|this section only applies to players in the us and canada . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9360|if you are having a problem with the service , many issues can be resolved on one of our forums . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9361|for issues relating to certain naturalmotion games , you may find resolution by clicking on the `` support '' link on that game 's page on naturalmotion 's website . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9362|before bringing a formal legal case , first contact our customer support team at https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com , or for black diamond slots , email support@risingtidegames.com , or for natural motion games email contact@naturalmotion.com to address your issue most disputes can be resolved that way . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9363|if we ca n't resolve our dispute through customer service , you and zynga or any member of the zynga corporate family all agree to resolve any claims relating to the terms , the privacy policy , feature terms or zynga 's services through final and binding arbitration . |1|1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|1
9364|this applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory , unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions in the exceptions to agreement to arbitrate sub-section . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9365|it also applies even after you stopped using your zynga account or deleted it . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9366|an arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury , so we are all giving up our right to a trial before a judge and jury . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9367|arbitrations have different rules than lawsuits in court . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9368|they are less formal than lawsuits in courts , and provide limited opportunity to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute -- a process called discovery . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9369|the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9370|but , if any of us does not like the arbitrator 's decision , the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9371|if we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute , we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that , too . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9372|in addition , if you , zynga or a zynga corporate family member brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated , the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim -lrb- i.e. , compel arbitration -rrb- . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9373|you , zynga or the zynga corporate family member may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9374|the american arbitration association -lrb- aaa -rrb- will run the arbitration between you and zynga or the zynga corporate family member , and aaa 's then-current rules and procedures -lrb- including their supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes -rrb- will be used . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9375|if something in these terms is different than aaa 's rules and procedures , then we will follow these terms instead . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9376|you can look at aaa 's rules and procedures on their website www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879 . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9377|to start an arbitration proceeding , use the form on aaa 's website -lrb- www.adr.org -rrb- or call them at 1-800-778-7879 . |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
9378|we all agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to |-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1|-1
